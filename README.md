- Muted, non-distracting color palette
- Keyboard-first navigation for flow state
- Clear visual hierarchy and purposeful interactions

npm run build   # Build for production
npm run start   # Start production server
npm run lint    # Run ESLint
```

The app uses:
- App Router for file-based routing
- Server Components where possible
- Client Components for interactive features
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
