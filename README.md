## Design Philosophy

Inspired by distraction-free writing tools like Calmly Writer, the interface prioritizes:
- Generous whitespace and comfortable reading typography
- Muted, non-distracting color palette
- Keyboard-first navigation for flow state
- Clear visual hierarchy and purposeful interactions

## Development

This is a Next.js project. Key commands:

```bash
npm run dev     # Start development server
npm run build   # Build for production
npm run start   # Start production server
npm run lint    # Run ESLint
```

The app uses:
- App Router for file-based routing
- Server Components where possible
- Client Components for interactive features
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Vector embeddings for semantic search
